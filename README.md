### Project Details:
_This project is built with React, calling data from [RandomUserData](https://randomuser.me/) to fill in data with real looking 
information. It utilizes  Avatar, user & profile Data from [RandomUserData](https://randomuser.me/). The Header has a Avatar & User Name that displays
a Default name first, then once profile page is clicked it loads header with Avatar and Name so it matches Profile page. All links are active and link 
to various things like my profile site, Youtube, FaceBook ext ext... The Avatar picture and Name tag if clicked takes you to the user Profile page. Navigation
is on the left and ads are on the right. _ <br />

### Pages: 
**Home:**<br />
_The home page displays an Info box displaying how many messages you have (from Chat Board). There is a Friends Icon also that brings you to the friends page._
**IN - Progress....** <br />

**Chat:**<br />
_The Chat page displays a form and chat/Message section (message Board). The form provides a way to post a message with your choice of Avatar with a 
status. Messages show in the chat box/message Board, edit & delete work. Local storage is being utilized to store nessacery data as needed._ <br />

**Friends:**<br />
_The Friends page shows a list of all your friends. This part utilises [RandomUserData](https://randomuser.me/). In the friends list it shows various data
for each person on a separate card with Avatar. If there is an error loading API Data an error will show after 1 min and while loading a loading sign shows._  <br />

**Profile:**
_The Profile page will display one user (User). When profile loads the Avatar & UserName will change to display the same data as profile card does. It does 
not store Avatar and UserName so after a refresh it will resort back to default Avatar & userName. If avatar or UserName is clicked on in the header it will
bring the user to the Profile page._<br />
